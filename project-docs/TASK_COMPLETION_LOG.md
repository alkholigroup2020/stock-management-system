## Completed Tasks

### ✅ 1.1.1 Project Initialization

**Completed:** November 4, 2025

Successfully initialized the Nuxt 4 project with all required dependencies for the MVP. Updated package.json to include @pinia/nuxt (^0.11.2), @vite-pwa/nuxt (^1.0.7), @prisma/client (^6.18.0), dayjs (^1.11.19), zod (^4.1.12), and nuxt-auth-utils (^0.5.25). All 289 packages installed successfully via pnpm, TypeScript configuration verified, and dev server tested - running smoothly on localhost:3000 with fast build times.

### ✅ 1.1.2 Environment Configuration

**Completed:** November 4, 2025

Established complete environment configuration infrastructure for the project. Created .env.example template and local .env file with all required variables (DATABASE_URL, Supabase credentials, AUTH_SECRET, and app config). Configured nuxt.config.ts with runtimeConfig separating private server-only keys from public client-exposed variables. Updated README.md with comprehensive environment setup documentation including step-by-step Supabase credential retrieval instructions and AUTH_SECRET generation commands. All environment variables properly documented with clear type distinctions (Private vs Public) and security notes.

### ✅ 1.1.3 Tailwind CSS v4 Configuration

**Completed:** November 4, 2025

Successfully configured Tailwind CSS v4 with custom brand colors for the application. Verified that Nuxt UI v4 includes Tailwind CSS through CSS imports (no separate @nuxtjs/tailwindcss module needed). The app/assets/css/main.css file was already properly configured with the @theme directive defining navy blue (#000046) and emerald green (#45cf7b) color palettes with all shades from 50-950. Configured color mode settings in nuxt.config.ts for light/dark theme support with proper defaults. Created comprehensive test page (app.vue) demonstrating all color shades, Nuxt UI components with custom colors, and dark mode functionality. Dev server compiled successfully with no errors. Verified app.config.ts has color configuration properly commented out (not needed with @theme directive). All color usage rules and guidelines are documented in CLAUDE.md including proper token usage, dark mode patterns, and common pitfalls to avoid.

### ✅ 1.1.4 Nuxt UI Configuration & Comprehensive Design System

**Completed:** November 5, 2025

Completed comprehensive Nuxt UI configuration, testing, and full design system implementation. Successfully implemented a production-ready design system tailored to the Stock Management System. Expanded color palettes from 2 to 6 (navy, emerald, zinc, amber, red, blue) with all shades 50-950 defined in main.css using @theme directive. Created 40+ semantic color tokens (backgrounds, text, borders, interactive states, feedback) with full light/dark mode support. Added business-specific tokens mapping directly to domain concepts: stock status (healthy/low/critical/pending), approval workflows (draft/pending/approved/rejected), and period states (open/ready/closed). Built 40+ utility classes for surfaces, forms, badges, and typography. Created comprehensive documentation in DESIGN_SYSTEM.md (750+ lines) and updated CLAUDE.md with design system guidelines and Tailwind CSS v4 @apply limitation notes.

### ✅ 1.2.1 Supabase Setup

**Completed:** November 5, 2025

Successfully configured Supabase cloud infrastructure for the Stock Management System. Created new Supabase project with database region optimized for Saudi Arabia. Generated and documented all required credentials including project URL, anon public key, and service_role key. Updated .env file with comprehensive instructions and placeholders for all Supabase environment variables (DATABASE_URL, SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_ANON_KEY, SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY). Pre-generated secure AUTH_SECRET using Node.js crypto module. Verified nuxt.config.ts runtime configuration properly separates private server-only keys from public client-exposed variables. All credentials securely stored in gitignored .env file with detailed inline documentation for future reference.

### ✅ 1.2.2 Prisma Setup

**Completed:** November 5, 2025

Successfully configured Prisma ORM for database access with PostgreSQL/Supabase integration. Created base prisma/schema.prisma file with PostgreSQL datasource configured to use DATABASE_URL environment variable and Prisma client generator. Added comprehensive database scripts to package.json (db:push, db:migrate, db:migrate:deploy, db:studio, db:generate, db:seed) following best practices from CLAUDE.md. Created server/utils/prisma.ts utility with singleton pattern to prevent hot-reload issues in development and proper logging configuration. Generated Prisma client successfully (v6.18.0) and validated schema compilation. Created health check API endpoint at server/api/health.get.ts to monitor database connectivity and Prisma initialization status. **Resolved database connection issue:** Discovered that Supabase requires Session mode connection pooler (pooler.supabase.com) instead of direct connections (db.supabase.co). Updated DATABASE_URL to use correct pooler format and verified successful connection via health endpoint showing "database: connected" status. Documented complete connection setup and troubleshooting in PRISMA_SETUP.md. Database connectivity fully operational and ready for schema development.

### ✅ 1.2.3 Prisma Schema - Core Entities

**Completed:** November 6, 2025

Successfully implemented all five core entity models in the Prisma schema, establishing the foundation for the multi-location stock management system. Defined four critical enums (UserRole, LocationType, AccessLevel, Unit) supporting role-based access control, location categorization, granular user permissions, and flexible inventory units. Created the User model with complete authentication support including username, email, password_hash, role-based access (OPERATOR/SUPERVISOR/ADMIN), default location assignment, and activity tracking. Implemented the Location model representing physical sites (Kitchen/Store/Central/Warehouse) with manager assignments, timezone support defaulting to Asia/Riyadh, and full lifecycle tracking. Built the UserLocation join table with composite primary key (user_id, location_id) enabling fine-grained access control per location with three levels (VIEW/POST/MANAGE) and audit trail of who assigned access and when.

Completed the Item model as the global product master with unique codes, flexible categorization (category/sub_category), configurable units (KG/EA/LTR/BOX/CASE/PACK), and soft-delete capability via is_active flag. Created the Supplier model for vendor management with unique codes and contact information. Established all necessary relations between entities including self-referencing relations (User.default_location, Location.manager, UserLocation.assigner) with proper cascade behaviors (Cascade for join table deletions, SetNull for optional references). Added strategic indexes on frequently queried fields (category, is_active) and join table foreign keys to optimize query performance. Validated complete schema compilation with pnpm prisma validate (✓ valid) and successfully generated Prisma Client (v6.18.0). All models follow PostgreSQL best practices with proper data types (@db.Uuid, @db.VarChar, @db.Text, @db.Timestamptz), default values, and map directives for clean table naming (users, locations, items, suppliers, user_locations). Schema fully aligned with Entities_ERD.md specifications and ready for Period & Stock models in task 1.2.4.

### ✅ 1.2.4 Prisma Schema - Period & Stock Models

**Completed:** November 6, 2025

Successfully implemented all Period and Stock management models in the Prisma schema, enabling the critical business logic for multi-location inventory tracking and coordinated period-end closing. Added two new enums (PeriodStatus, PeriodLocationStatus) to manage the period lifecycle (DRAFT/OPEN/PENDING_CLOSE/APPROVED/CLOSED) and per-location readiness states (OPEN/READY/CLOSED) for synchronized period closing across all locations. Created the Period model representing monthly accounting periods with start/end dates, status tracking, approval workflow integration (approval_id for future use), and timestamp audit trail (created_at, closed_at). Implemented the PeriodLocation join table with composite primary key (period_id, location_id) tracking individual location status within each period, capturing opening and closing stock values, maintaining JSON-based stock snapshots at period close, and recording readiness timestamps for coordinated closure workflow.

Developed the ItemPrice model to implement price locking per period with unique constraint on (item_id, period_id) ensuring one locked price per item per period, supporting automatic price variance detection in deliveries, with 4-decimal precision for accurate unit pricing and audit tracking of who set prices and when. Built the LocationStock model as the core inventory tracking table with composite primary key (location_id, item_id) maintaining real-time stock levels (on_hand quantity), Weighted Average Cost (WAC) calculations with 4-decimal precision, optional min/max stock thresholds for low-stock alerts, physical count timestamps (last_counted), and auto-updating timestamps. Added comprehensive relations to existing models: Location now includes period_locations and location_stock arrays; Item includes item_prices and location_stock arrays; Period connects to period_locations and item_prices. Implemented strategic indexes on all foreign keys, status fields, date ranges, and on_hand quantities for efficient querying of period operations, stock levels, and low-stock alerts. Successfully validated schema compilation with pnpm prisma generate (✓ Generated Prisma Client v6.18.0) with zero errors. All models align with WAC costing methodology, price variance NCR generation, and coordinated period-close requirements defined in PRD and System_Design documentation. Schema now ready for Transaction Models (task 1.2.5).

### ✅ 1.2.5 Prisma Schema - Transaction Models

**Completed:** November 6, 2025

Successfully implemented all transaction models in the Prisma schema, establishing the complete data layer for delivery receipts, stock issues, and purchase workflows. Added three critical enums (PRFStatus, POStatus, CostCentre) supporting purchase request lifecycle (DRAFT/PENDING/APPROVED/REJECTED), purchase order states (OPEN/CLOSED), and issue cost allocation (FOOD/CLEAN/OTHER). Created the PRF (Purchase Request Form) model with sequential numbering (prf_no), period and location context, approval workflow tracking (requested_by, approved_by), date tracking (request_date, approval_date), and status management. Implemented the PO (Purchase Order) model linking to PRFs and suppliers, with status tracking and total amount calculations. Built the Delivery model as the core goods receipt transaction with unique delivery numbers, period/location context, supplier and optional PO linkage, invoice and delivery note fields, delivery date tracking, automatic price variance detection flag (has_variance), and user audit trail (posted_by, posted_at). Created the DeliveryLine model for line-level detail with item references, quantity tracking (4-decimal precision), dual pricing (unit_price actual vs period_price expected), automatic price variance calculation, line value computation, and optional NCR linkage for price variance tracking.

Developed the Issue model for stock consumption tracking with unique issue numbers, period/location context, cost centre categorization (FOOD/CLEAN/OTHER), total value calculations, and user audit trail. Implemented the IssueLine model capturing item-level details with quantity tracking, WAC at time of issue (critical for correct valuation without recalculation), and automatic line value computation. Updated all existing models with reverse relations: User now includes requested_prfs, approved_prfs, posted_deliveries, and posted_issues arrays; Location includes prfs, deliveries, and issues arrays; Period includes prfs, deliveries, and issues arrays; Supplier includes purchase_orders and deliveries arrays; Item includes delivery_lines and issue_lines arrays. Added comprehensive performance indexes on all foreign keys (period_id, location_id, supplier_id, po_id, item_id), status fields, date fields (request_date, delivery_date, issue_date), cost_centre for filtering, has_variance for price variance queries, and ncr_id for NCR tracking. Successfully validated complete schema with pnpm prisma generate (✓ Generated Prisma Client v6.18.0) and pnpm prisma validate (✓ valid) with zero compilation errors. All transaction models fully support the critical business workflows including automatic price variance NCR generation on deliveries, WAC-based stock valuation on issues, purchase request approval flows, and comprehensive audit trails. Schema now complete through task 1.2.5 and ready for Transfer Models (task 1.2.6).

### ✅ 1.2.6 Prisma Schema - Transfer Models

**Completed:** November 6, 2025

Successfully implemented inter-location transfer models in the Prisma schema, completing the core transaction entity set for multi-location stock movement tracking. Added the TransferStatus enum supporting the complete transfer lifecycle workflow (DRAFT/PENDING_APPROVAL/APPROVED/REJECTED/COMPLETED) with clear separation between approval and execution states. Created the Transfer model as the header-level transaction with unique transfer numbers (transfer_no format: TRF-2025-001), dual location references (from_location_id, to_location_id) enabling stock movement between any two locations, comprehensive approval workflow tracking (requested_by, approved_by with User relations), three-phase date tracking (request_date, approval_date, transfer_date), total value calculation for transfer cost tracking, and flexible notes field for transfer justification and details.

Implemented the TransferLine model for item-level transfer details with item references, quantity tracking (4-decimal precision matching stock system), WAC at transfer time from source location (critical for accurate cost transfer without recalculation), and automatic line value computation (quantity × wac_at_transfer). Updated all affected models with reverse relations: User now includes requested_transfers and approved_transfers arrays supporting supervisor/admin approval workflows; Location includes transfers_from and transfers_to arrays enabling tracking of all inbound and outbound transfers per location; Item includes transfer_lines array for complete item movement history. Added strategic performance indexes on from_location_id and to_location_id for location-specific queries, status for workflow filtering, request_date and transfer_date for temporal analysis, plus standard indexes on transfer_id and item_id foreign keys in TransferLine. Successfully validated complete schema with pnpm prisma validate (✓ schema is valid) and pnpm prisma generate (✓ Generated Prisma Client v6.18.0 in 235ms) with zero compilation errors. Transfer models fully support the critical cross-location stock movement workflow including supervisor approval requirements, atomic stock updates on completion, WAC-based cost transfer maintaining location-specific costing, and comprehensive audit trail for compliance. All transaction models (PRF, PO, Delivery, Issue, Transfer) now complete and ready for Control Models (task 1.2.7: NCR, POB, Reconciliation, Approval).

### ✅ 1.2.7 Prisma Schema - Control Models

**Completed:** November 6, 2025

Successfully implemented all control and workflow models in the Prisma schema, completing the database layer for quality management, manpower tracking, reconciliations, and approval workflows. Added four critical enums: NCRType (MANUAL/PRICE_VARIANCE), NCRStatus (OPEN/SENT/CREDITED/REJECTED/RESOLVED), ApprovalEntityType (PRF/PO/PERIOD_CLOSE/TRANSFER), and ApprovalStatus (PENDING/APPROVED/REJECTED). Created the NCR model for non-conformance tracking with unique ncr_no, type differentiation for manual vs auto-generated reports, delivery/delivery_line linkage for price variance NCRs, quantity and value tracking, status lifecycle management, and resolution tracking. Implemented the POB model for daily headcount with composite unique constraint (period_id, location_id, date), crew_count and extra_count fields supporting manday cost calculations, and complete audit trail. Built the Reconciliation model for period-end reporting with unique constraint per period-location, comprehensive financial tracking (opening_stock, receipts, transfers_in/out, issues, closing_stock), adjustment fields (back_charges, credits, condemnations), and auto-updating timestamps. Developed the Approval model as a generic workflow engine with entity_type and entity_id for polymorphic references, status tracking, requester/reviewer user linkage, timestamp tracking, and optional comments field.

Updated all affected models with reverse relations: User includes created_ncrs, entered_pobs, requested_approvals, and reviewed_approvals; Location includes ncrs, pobs, and reconciliations; Period includes pobs and reconciliations; Delivery includes ncrs; DeliveryLine includes ncrs for price variance linking. Added comprehensive indexes on all foreign keys, type/status fields, dates, and auto_generated flag for efficient querying. Successfully validated with pnpm prisma validate (✓ schema is valid) and generated Prisma Client v6.18.0 in 251ms. All control models fully support business requirements including automatic price variance NCR generation, manday cost calculations, period-end reconciliation workflows, and multi-entity approval processes. Complete database schema now includes 24 models across 6 categories (Core, Period & Stock, Transactions, Transfers, Controls) ready for migration (task 1.2.8).

### ✅ 1.2.8 Prisma Schema - Indexes & Relations

**Completed:** November 6, 2025

Successfully optimized the complete Prisma schema with comprehensive performance indexes and documented database constraints. Added 23 strategic indexes including single-field indexes on User (role, is_active, default_location_id), Location (type, is_active, manager_id), and Transfer (requested_by, created_by), plus composite indexes for common query patterns: UserLocation (user_id + access_level), PeriodLocation (period_id + status), Delivery (period_id + location_id, location_id + has_variance), Issue (period_id + location_id, location_id + cost_centre), Transfer (from_location_id + status, to_location_id + status), NCR (location_id + status, location_id + type), POB (period_id + location_id), and Approval (entity_type + entity_id, entity_type + status). These indexes optimize critical query patterns including role-based access control, location filtering, period operations, price variance detection, transfer workflows, and approval processing.

Documented 8 check constraints for database integrity to be implemented in migrations: positive stock/WAC checks on LocationStock, positive price check on ItemPrice, different locations validation on Transfer, positive quantity checks on all transaction lines, positive value checks on transaction totals, positive people counts on POB, and period date range validation. Verified all 24 models have proper bidirectional relations with correct cascade behaviors (Cascade for dependent data, Restrict for referential integrity, SetNull for optional references). Successfully validated complete schema with pnpm prisma validate (✓ schema is valid) and generated Prisma Client v6.18.0 in 241ms with zero errors.

### ✅ 1.3.8 Route Protection

**Completed:** November 8, 2025

Successfully implemented comprehensive client-side route protection with global authentication middleware and role-based authorization. Created global auth middleware (app/middleware/auth.global.ts) running on every route navigation, automatically redirecting unauthenticated users to /login with redirect query parameter preserving intended destination, fetching user session on first load for proper auth state initialization, and allowing authenticated users to access protected routes. Implemented role-based middleware (app/middleware/role.ts) with flexible authorization patterns supporting single role requirements (roleRequired: 'ADMIN'), multiple role options (roleRequired: ['ADMIN', 'SUPERVISOR']), and minimum role level checks (minRole: 'SUPERVISOR' for supervisor-or-higher access). Built role hierarchy system (OPERATOR=1, SUPERVISOR=2, ADMIN=3) enabling proper privilege escalation checks. Enhanced login page to handle redirect query parameters, automatically routing users to their original destination after successful authentication, preventing circular redirects, and defaulting to dashboard when no redirect specified. Created comprehensive test pages demonstrating route protection: test-admin.vue requiring ADMIN role only, test-supervisor.vue requiring minimum SUPERVISOR role (SUPERVISOR or ADMIN access), both displaying user information, role verification, and permission checks with visual indicators. All TypeScript compilation passed with zero errors (pnpm typecheck). Route protection system fully operational with proper authentication guards, role-based access control, and seamless redirect flows ready for production use across all application pages.

### ✅ 1.3.9 Role-Based UI Elements

Updated AppNavbar component (app/components/layout/AppNavbar.vue) with sidebar toggle buttons (separate for desktop/mobile), brand logo with "SM Stock Management" text, theme switcher, and user dropdown menu with logout functionality. Created AppSidebar component (app/components/layout/AppSidebar.vue) featuring 10 navigation menu items (Dashboard, POB, Items & Prices, Deliveries, Issues, Transfers, NCR, Stock Now, Reconciliations, Period Close) with icons, active route highlighting using Nuxt UI's UIcon, mobile overlay with dark backdrop, and smooth slide-in/out transitions.

Implemented full responsive design tested across three breakpoints using Playwright: desktop (1280x720) with sidebar visible by default, tablet (768x1024) with sidebar hidden but toggleable, and mobile (375x667) with hamburger menu triggering overlay sidebar. Layout uses semantic design tokens throughout (--ui-bg, --ui-bg-elevated, --ui-border, --ui-text, --ui-primary) ensuring consistent theming in light/dark modes. Sidebar state managed via Vue provide/inject pattern enabling coordinated behavior between navbar toggles and sidebar component. All transitions utilize Tailwind CSS classes with 300ms duration for smooth UX. Layout successfully tested end-to-end with authentication flow showing proper navbar user menu integration and sidebar navigation working across all screen sizes. Application now has professional, production-ready layout foundation supporting all future feature pages with consistent navigation and responsive mobile-first design.

### ✅ 1.4.2 App Navbar Component

**Completed:** November 9, 2025

Successfully enhanced the App Navbar with dynamic location switching and period indicators, completing the navigation infrastructure for the Stock Management System. Created three global Pinia stores: location store (app/stores/location.ts) managing active location state and user-accessible locations with automatic default location selection, period store (app/stores/period.ts) tracking current open period with date range formatting and days remaining calculations, and UI store (app/stores/ui.ts) handling sidebar state, toast notifications, and modal management. Implemented server API endpoints including /api/user/locations.get.ts returning all active locations for admins/supervisors or assigned locations for operators with access levels, and /api/periods/current.get.ts fetching the current OPEN period. Built LocationSwitcher component (app/components/layout/LocationSwitcher.vue) with dropdown menu displaying all accessible locations, toast notifications on location switch, and responsive design showing full location name on desktop, icon on mobile. Created PeriodIndicator component (app/components/layout/PeriodIndicator.vue) displaying period name, date range, status badge with color coding (success for OPEN, warning for PENDING_CLOSE), responsive across desktop/tablet/mobile breakpoints. Integrated both components into AppNavbar with center-aligned location/period section separated by divider, responsive user menu showing full name on desktop and avatar-only on mobile. Tested end-to-end with Playwright across three breakpoints: desktop (1280x720) showing full navbar with location name/period details, tablet (768x1024) with condensed period display, and mobile (375x667) with icon-only navigation. All stores properly fetch data on mount, handle loading/error states, and support admin/supervisor/operator role-based access patterns. Navbar now provides complete context awareness for users showing current location and period at all times.

### ✅ 1.4.5 Toast Notifications Setup

**Completed:** November 9, 2025

Successfully implemented comprehensive toast notification system with brand-aligned styling for user feedback throughout the application. Configured Nuxt UI toast by wrapping the application with UApp component and adding UNotifications component to app.vue, enabling global toast functionality. Created useAppToast composable (app/composables/useAppToast.ts) providing developer-friendly wrapper around Nuxt UI's useToast() with four predefined notification types: success() using emerald green color with check-circle icon for confirmations, error() using red color with circle-x icon and longer 7-second duration for critical messages, warning() using amber color with alert-triangle icon and 6-second duration for cautionary alerts, and info() using navy blue primary color with info icon for informational messages. All toast types support customizable titles, descriptions, durations, icons, and action buttons with proper TypeScript interfaces for type safety. Implemented clear() method for dismissing all active toasts and exposed underlying toast instance for advanced usage scenarios. Successfully tested all toast types end-to-end using Playwright browser automation confirming proper visual styling with brand colors (emerald success, red error, amber warning, navy info), correct icon rendering (lucide icons), progress bar animations, action button functionality, and responsive bottom-right positioning. Toast notifications now provide consistent, professional user feedback across all application features with semantic color coding aligned to the Stock Management System design system.

### ✅ 1.5.1 Location API Routes

**Completed:** November 9, 2025

Successfully implemented comprehensive Location API with five RESTful endpoints providing complete CRUD operations for location management. Created GET /api/locations endpoint with filtering support (type, is_active, search) returning all locations for admins/supervisors or assigned locations for operators, including manager information, user assignments count, and stock items count. Implemented POST /api/locations endpoint for admin-only location creation with Zod validation for code (unique, uppercase), name, type (KITCHEN/STORE/CENTRAL/WAREHOUSE), address, manager assignment, and timezone (defaults to Asia/Riyadh). Built GET /api/locations/:id endpoint fetching single location details with comprehensive related data including manager info and transaction counts (deliveries, issues, transfers). Created PATCH /api/locations/:id endpoint for admin-only updates supporting partial updates to name, type, address, manager, timezone, and active status with proper validation. Developed GET /api/locations/:id/users endpoint returning all users assigned to a location with access levels, role information, and assignment audit trail.

All endpoints implement proper authentication/authorization checks: admin-only restrictions for create/update operations, operators limited to assigned locations for view operations, admins/supervisors granted access to all locations. Comprehensive error handling implemented with standard HTTP status codes (400 validation errors, 401 unauthorized, 403 forbidden, 404 not found, 409 duplicate code conflict, 500 internal server errors) and structured error responses with code/message/details format. Successfully tested all endpoints end-to-end including successful operations (fetch all locations, fetch single location, create location, update location, fetch location users), query filters (type=KITCHEN, is_active=true, search=Main), and error scenarios (non-existent location 404, duplicate code 409 conflict). All API routes now production-ready with proper Prisma database integration, Zod schema validation, role-based access control, and comprehensive error handling ready for frontend location management UI implementation (task 1.5.2).
